By implementing this infrastructure, the **Roster Management Service** will be secure, scalable, cost-efficient, and easy to maintain. You can manage different services like member management, event scheduling, and booking in a highly distributed, cloud-native environment.

### **Detailed Infrastructure Setup for API Gateway, Cron Scheduler, and Worker Services**

The infrastructure setup for the **API Gateway**, **Cron Scheduler**, and **Worker Services** needs to ensure high availability, scalability, cost-efficiency, and security. Below is a detailed breakdown of how each service will be configured in a cloud-native environment using AWS, along with best practices for ensuring optimal performance.

---

### **1. API Gateway Infrastructure**

---

### **2. Cron Scheduler Infrastructure**

**Goal**: Manage scheduling, triggering, and status tracking of cron jobs.

**Services Involved**:

- **Cron Jobs & Scheduler**: **AWS Lambda** with **EventBridge** for scheduling cron jobs at regular intervals (e.g., weekly schedules).
- **Task Queue**: **Amazon SQS** or **RabbitMQ** to queue tasks for execution by worker services.
- **Database**: Use **Amazon RDS** (PostgreSQL) or **DynamoDB** for storing job-related metadata, task statuses, cron expressions, etc.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: **CloudWatch** to monitor cron job statuses, failures, and retries.

**Steps**:

  - Set up **AWS EventBridge** to trigger **Lambda** functions at specific cron intervals (using cron expressions like `0 0 * * SUN`).
- **Task Queue Setup**:
  - Use **Amazon SQS** or **RabbitMQ** to store tasks that need to be processed asynchronously.
  - **Amazon SQS** integrates well with Lambda for event-driven architectures.
  - Each task type (e.g., `send_notifications`, `generate_schedule`) will be placed in a queue and processed by the **Worker Services**.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE cron_jobs (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      task_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      cron_expression VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      status ENUM('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed') NOT NULL,
      last_run TIMESTAMP,
      next_run TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```
- **Monitoring**:
  - Set up **CloudWatch** metrics and dashboards for monitoring the execution status of cron jobs.

  - Worker containers will pull tasks from the queue and process them asynchronously (e.g., sending notifications or generating schedules).
  - Container services will be auto-scaled based on the queue size and resource usage.
  - Alternatively, use **AWS Lambda** for lightweight worker services.
- **Task Queue Integration**:
  - The worker services will poll the queue (SQS/RabbitMQ) for tasks.
  - Each task will be processed by a separate worker service, ensuring scalability.
- **Database Integration**:
  - As workers process tasks, they will update job statuses and logs in the **RDS** or **DynamoDB** database.
  - Use **S3** for storing large logs and files generated by workers (e.g., reports, notifications).
- **Task Retries**:
  - For failed tasks, use **AWS Step Functions** for retry logic or **Lambda Destinations** to capture errors and retry jobs up to a certain limit.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Monitor worker services using **CloudWatch** for metrics like task success rate, task duration, and queue length.
  - Set up alarms in **CloudWatch** to alert if worker services are underperforming or queue size increases significantly.

  - Implement **lifecycle policies** to archive older files in **S3 Glacier**.

---

### **5. Cost Optimization Strategies**

**Goal**: Optimize costs for serverless tasks and resources.

**Strategies**:

- **Lambda for Serverless Execution**: Use **AWS Lambda** for lightweight tasks like notifications and reminders. This will minimize the cost for short-running tasks that don’t require constant infrastructure.
- **ECS Fargate** for Long-Running Tasks: Use **Fargate** for long-running tasks (like generating schedules), as it automatically scales and charges based on the actual compute resources used.
- **Auto Scaling**: Configure **auto-scaling** for ECS and Lambda based on queue length and task execution time.
- **Reserved Instances** for RDS**: Use **RDS Reserved Instances\*\* for long-term cost savings, as the cron job metadata will require consistent access.
- **SQS & DynamoDB**: Use **SQS** for queue management and **DynamoDB** for low-latency, high-throughput operations at low cost.
